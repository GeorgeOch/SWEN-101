Hello, my name is George. I am from Parma, Ohio and I attended Padua Franciscan High School. I am the youngest in my family and have 3 siblings. I also have a pet dog. I love watching and playing sports, watching movies/TV shows, playing video games, and reading. I am a huge basketball fan and have played it for most of my life. My favorite TV shows are Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, and The Bear. I am enjoying my time at RIT so far and I hope that I can continue to meet new people and make new friends.
